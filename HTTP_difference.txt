Difference between HTTP!.1 vs HTTP2.0
=>HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol and it is used in client-server communication.
=>By using HTTP user sends the request to the server and the server sends the responses to the user.
=> The term hypertext was coined by "Ted Nelson" in 1965.
=>It is used to improve the communications between the client and the servers.

 HTTP/1.1:
=>HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997.
=> HTTP pipelining in order to further reduce lag time when using persistent connections by allowing clients to send multiple requests before waiting for each response.
 This optimization was never considered really safe because a few web servers and many proxy servers, specially transparent proxy servers placed in Internet between clients and servers,
  did not handle pipelined requests properly before introduction of HTTP 2.0
=>Request methods of HTTP/1.1 specification  added five new methods: PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, and TRACE. Any client can use any method and the server can be configured to support any combination of methods. 
The request methods are always CASE SENSITIVE.
=> the HTTP 1.1 is like a three-way handshake TCP connection.
=> it is a bit slower than the version upgraded after this.
=> it gives only the data which we asks.
=>There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
=>it works on the textul format and the data is compressed by own itself.


HTTP/2.0:
=>it was introduced in the year 2015.
=>It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
=>it is a bit faster than the previous version.
=>Less prone to errors.
=>Lighter network footprint.
=>Effective network resource utilization. 
=>It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
=>It uses HPACK for data compression.
=>HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol. HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual that converts all the messages in binary format.
=> The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame.
